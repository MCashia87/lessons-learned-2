In specifying a programming project it is useful to understand the difference between a story and an epic.  
An epic is a longer project that will take more than a few days and can be broken down into multiples independent stories.  
In breaking down an epic, each story should be:

Independent
Negotiable
Valuable
Estimable
Small
Testable

As a rule of thumb, generally a story can be completed in no more than a few days and epics will generally be anything longer than this period.
