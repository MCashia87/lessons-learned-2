Executives often struggle with understanding what is the most cost efficient and consumer effective program to build first
Often, this struggle is first encountered when deciding whether to first build a website, an app, or a website that can appropriately handle mobile devices.
In making this decision, as with many other decisions in business, the executive should think about the user experience.
That is, will the user be more likely to access the platform from a mobile device such as a phone or from a home or work desktop?
The answer to this question, along with the availability of funding, will be the guiding principle as to which program to develop first.
It is important to remember that the majority of page views for many websites are already from mobile devices.
However, if your service is for something more time intensive, or detailed, a user may be more likely to reserve time on a desktop to access your site.
Or, if you believe that your service is something that will be accessed frequently or on the go, an application will be the better path forward.
In regards to what type of website, a responsive web site will display different information for different devices.
That is, if the site is accessed from a mobile device the user will see a different page than he or she would see if the site was accessed via a laptop.
On the other hand, there are mobile first designs which are websites made with the understanding and expectation that users will most likely access the site from mobile devices.  
As such, sites designed under this method optimize your site for mobile usage and can enhance the site with additional elements for users who have larger screens.
Generally speaking, mobile designed websites are more expensive to build than non-mobile designed sites.
But what if we decide an app is better suited.
In that case, there are three broad approaches.
Each different approach has different costs and time components.
The easiest and simplest is PhoneGap/Cordova, which is a tool that allows you to take a front end website and package it as an app.  
Another approach is the Titanium Appcelerator, which allows the programer to write in code and deploy native looking apps on iOS and Adroid.
Lastly, there are native applications, which are written in the language of the phone.
Generally speaking, PhoneGap is the cheapest (assuming a previous site) and a native application is the most expensive.
While there is no right answer, a PhoneGap approach or Titanium Appcelerator may allow you to ‘test the market’ more cheaply than simply writing a native application.
If the test is successful, a native application could then be written.
